Gremlin Plugin
==============

http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com[Gremlin] is a Groovy based Graph Traversal Language and provides a very expressive
way of explicitly scripting traversals through a Neo4j graph.

The Neo4j Gremlin Plugin provides an endpoint to send Gremlin scripts to the Neo4j Server, have them executed
on the server database and return the results as Neo4j Node and Relationship representations, thus keeping
the types throughout the REST API consistent.
